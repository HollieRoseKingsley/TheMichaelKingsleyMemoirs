# The memoirs of Michael Kingsley.
I have found my fathers journals from my when he was a child all the way until his recent passing, I am digitising them in this format in order to preserve his memory and also to discover more about him, a way for me to be closer to my father.

My father served in the British army for the majority of his life, he was a friend to all, a highly decorated soldier, and most of all a loving father to me and my sisters.
